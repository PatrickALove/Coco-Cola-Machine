# Coco-Cola Machine
REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT
 
Application title:   Vending Machine
Purpose:	           The vending machine program will allow the user to make selections from a drink machine.
                     The user will simulate inserting coins.  When enough “money” has been entered, the user 
                     will make his/her selection of a drink.

Program 
Procedures:
	From a window on the screen, the user will click buttons to simulate money being entered into the machine.  When enough money has been accepted by the machine then the user make his/her drink selection.

 
Algorithms,
Processing and
Conditions:
	1.	The user must be able to view the drink selections at any given time.
2.	The user will enter money by clicking on buttons on the machine.  The machine maintains its state (i.e. how much total money has been inserted and whether enough has been entered to permit the selection of a drink).
3.	The drink machine should have a minimum of 6 selections.  The user will click the button of the selection.  All drinks should have the same price ($1.25).
4.	As money is inserted, the total amount entered so far should be displayed.  If the user selects an item that has a price that exceeds the total money entered so far, an appropriate message should be displayed to the user.
5.	After a selection has been made, a message should tell the user what he/she has selected and “return” any change to the user (any amount over $1.25).
6.	Valid amounts for money that the user enters should be:  5 cents, 10 cents, 25 cents and 1 dollar.

Notes and 
Restrictions:	
As noted above.  If 75 cents is entered into the drink machine and the user tries to select a drink, the user should receive an “insufficient funds inserted” message.

Comments:
	
1.	Try to get pictures to show for the items on the drink machine buttons, similar to the actual machines.
2.	You must have a minimum of 6 different drink items so choose from.  You may use more if you choose.
3.	There should be an “Exit” button at the bottom of the window which will allow the user to quit the application.
4.	All controls and variables must have meaningful names which begin with the prefixes found in Appendix B of your textbook.
